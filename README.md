# Bubbleanim	

Is an an ambient bubble demo using [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/). There are two different branches: master and (my favourite) beer.

At the moment I've put the animation into a html5 boilerplate but I'll package the src into a discrete plugin at later stage.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

## Running

Just point a server at the root directory (bubbleanim). I'd recommend [nws](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nws)

### Building

To build the scss:

* `cd scss`
* `compass watch`

### Deploying

* `grunt`
