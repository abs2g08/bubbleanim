# Bubbleanim	

Is an ambient bubble animation using [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/). There are three different branches: master, snowflake, and (my favourite) beer.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

## Running

Just point a server at the root directory (bubbleanim). I'd recommend [nws](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nws)

### Building

To build the scss:

* `cd scss`
* `compass watch`

### Deploying

* `grunt`
